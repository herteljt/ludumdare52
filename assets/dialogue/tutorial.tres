Trainer: Ok, next. Who are you, then?
Player: 
- It’s me, Death!
	You picked \"It's me, Death!\"
- I’m Death, bub!
- Are these really my only choices?



Trainer: Yes, those are your only choices. They’ll matter later, I promise. And you are NOT Death. We’d have to pay you overtime if you were Death. You’re a Non-living Contractor, and NLC. You’re only one of many, and you CAN be replaced.

Player:
- Nope!
	Trainer: Fine, I’ll make it easy, pick up, make them talk to you about bad stuff they did, then drop them in the Styx.
- Yes!
	Trainer: Amazing. Someone with half a brain left rattling around in that bone box.
- examples, please!
	Trainer: I’m getting to that!

Trainer: Anyway, I am here to teach you how to do your job. I know what you’re thinking, right? Why does a self directed app based business need someone to train every single user? And to that I say, shut up. First off, choose a file.

set dossier_scene = true
#Two options show up they are both:

#Image: Blandest person ever
#Dossier: Jane Doe

Trainer: Jane was a retail sales employee. She hated Mondays. Her 1.94 children loved playing and fun. She died by a heart attack at 77.28 years old.
set character = 2

Trainer: Yes, I know they are the same, it’s for demonstration purposes, and good thing too. A person that average would collapse space time.

Player:
- I’ll choose Jane!
	Trainer: Sounds good. 
- Jane’s my choice!
	Trainer: A rebel, eh?
- Why are you doing this to me?
	Trainer: You say you want Jane, eh?

set dossier_scene = false 
set driving_scene = true 

Trainer:Ok, so now you are gonna go pick her up, and drive her to her ultimate fate. But that’s the easy bit. The hard part is getting them to talk about themselves. The stuff they did. The worse the better. Cause that pushes up their fare, and the higher the fare, the longer they stay in Purgatory and out o’ the bosses’ way. Then you let them out and after a quick dunk in the Styx, they are good to go. We clear?

Reap: The fare tracks how much a soul is worth. 
- Choice 1
	You picked Choice 1.
	do update_score(10)
- Choice 2
	You picked Choice 2.
- Choice 3
	You picked Choice 3.

Reap: More damning information = more value.

Reap: You work as a driver for soulsharing app DeadLyft.
Reap: You've been tasked with trying to ferry the souls to the everafter.
Reap: As you drive, you'll engage in conversations with patrons and have to make choices about where to push the conversation.
- Tell me more.
	Reap: Of course!
- End the convesation. => END
- Start again => tutorial_start_node

Reap: You see, Hell runneth over. So the higher-ups have tasked you with extending the stay of souls in purgatory. 
Reap: The more information you can harvest from an individual, the longer their stay in purgatory will be.
Reap: Your task is to get as much information as possible without upsetting a soul too much.
- So I'm trying to get them to tell me the terrible things they did without realizing it?
	Reap: Yep, basically.
- End the convesation. => END
- Start again => tutorial_start_node
Reap: As souls tell you their mischief, you'll see the fare increase.
Reap: You need to make you daily quota of course. We're professionals here.
Reap: Any questions?
- Yeah, what you mean by fare?
- End the convesation. => END

Dossier: Mike did two tours in Vietnam and after the war got a job building cars. He married his high school sweetheart Eleanor and raised a family of four kids, the eldest a boy and the other three girls. He was laid off in the eighties and worked a series of retail jobs until his retirement in 2014, and he has been painting watercolors in his spare time since.  

Dossier: 
He died of a blow to the head from his lovely wife Eleanor. => Mike_Dowager

~ Mike_Dowager

Direction: You arrive at a rather run down home in the suburbs, the white picket fence overgrown with weeds and the yard littered with various bits of construction materials. Half the home has had its siding torn off, with no sign of work being done to replace it.

Direction: Mike walks off of the porch and down a barely visible garden path toward the curb, careful to avoid the absolutely baffling amount of yard gnomes, spinning sunflowers, and other kitchy googaws that line it.

Direction: As he sits down in the car he makes a series of pops and creaks accompanied by a steady stream of muttered profanity.Once settled into the seat he waves his phone at you angrily.

Mike: I don’t know if I did this right. My boy showed me how to use this thing, but it never works right. Are you Craig?

Player:
- No, I am a psychopomp, here to ferry you to the beyond. 
	Mike: Say what? Look, I ain’t got time for no performance art weirdness, I just gotta get to…huh….not sure where I was going. Just drive, I guess.
- That’s me!
	Mike: Right, good. Take me to…err…dammit, I don’t remember. Just drive.
- Craig was sick, I’m filling in.
	Mike: Right, right. 
	Directions: He waits for a moment for you to introduce yourself. When it becomes clear you will not he shakes his head,.
	Mike: Fine then. Well I think I chose my destination in the thing already, just drive."
