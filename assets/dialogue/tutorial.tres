Trainer: Ok, next. Who are you, then?

Player: 
- It’s me, Death!
- I’m Death, bub!
- Are these really my only choices?

Trainer: Yes, those are your only choices. They’ll matter later, I promise. And you are NOT Death. We’d have to pay you overtime if you were Death. You’re a Non-living Contractor, an NLC. You’re only one of many, and you CAN be replaced.

Player:
- How did you know what I was going to say?
	Trainer: I didn’t, I only knew the outcomes.
- Can you read minds?
	Trainer: Yes.
- You are going to ignore whatever I say, aren’t you?
	Trainer: No.

Trainer: Anyway, I am here to teach you how to do your job. I know what you’re thinking, right? Why does a self directed app-based business need someone to train every single user? And to that I say, shut up. First off, choose a file.

- Jane Doe

Trainer: Jane Doe was a retail sales employee. She hated Mondays. Her 1.94 children loved playing and fun. She died by a heart attack at 77.28 years old.

Trainer: Yes, I know they are the same, it’s for demonstration purposes, and good thing too. Even one person that average would collapse space time.

Player:
- I’ll choose Jane!
	Trainer: Sounds good.
- Jane’s my choice!
	Trainer: A rebel, eh?
- Why are you doing this to me?
	Trainer: You say you want Jane, eh?

Trainer: Ok, so now you are gonna go pick her up and drive her to her ultimate fate. But that’s the easy bit. The hard part is getting them to talk about themselves. The stuff they did. The worse the better. Cause that pushes up their fare, and the higher the fare, the longer they stay in Purgatory and out o’ the bosses’ way. Then you let them out and after a quick dunk in the Styx, they are good to go. We clear?

Player:
- Nope!
	Trainer: Fine, I’ll make it easy, pick up, make them talk to you about bad stuff they did, then drop them in the Styx.
- Yes!
	Trainer: Amazing. Someone with half a brain left rattling around in that bone box.
- examples, please!
	Trainer: I’m getting to that!

Trainer: Ok, so we’re gonna practice once, you and me. I’ll be Jane. I’m gettin’ into the car now.

- I don’t believe so, no. You ever see a dead body?
	do update_score(5,0)
	Trainer: Weird, but whatever…lets say she likes that for some reason, see your fare go up? That means you did good.
- You’re dead and I’m here to reap you! Get out of here while you can!
	Trainer: See, this is a code of conduct infraction right here, luckily, the dead just ignore anything about how their dead, so it don’t even phase me. Don’t help your fare though.

Trainer: Wanna try the other options real quick?
- Sure, let me try… 
	=> first_question
- Nope, I get it. Let’s get to work!

Reap: This tutorial will show you how to play the game.
Reap: You work as a driver for soulsharing app DeadLyft.
Reap: You've been tasked with trying to ferry the souls to the everafter.
Reap: As you drive, you'll engage in conversations with patrons and have to make choices about where to push the conversation.
- Tell me more.

Reap: You see, Hell runneth over. So the higher-ups have tasked you with extending the stay of souls in purgatory. 
Reap: The more information you can harvest from an individual, the longer their stay in purgatory will be.
Reap: Your task is to get as much information as possible without upsetting a soul too much.
- So I'm trying to get them to tell me the terrible things they did without realizing it?
	Reap: Yep, basically.
- End the convesation. => END
- Start again => tutorial_start_node
Reap: As souls tell you their mischief, you'll see the fare increase.
Reap: You need to make you daily quota of course. We're professionals here.
