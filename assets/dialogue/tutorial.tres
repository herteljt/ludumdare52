Trainer: Ok, next. Who are you, then?

Player: 
- It’s me, Death!
- I’m Death, bub!
- Are these really my only choices?

Trainer: Yes, those are your only choices. They’ll matter later, I promise. And you are NOT Death. We’d have to pay you overtime if you were Death. You’re a Non-living Contractor, and NLC. You’re only one of many, and you CAN be replaced.

Player:
- How did you know what I was going to say?
	Trainer: I didn’t, I only knew the outcomes.
- Can you read minds?
	Trainer: Yes.
- You are going to ignore whatever I say, aren’t you?
	Trainer: No.

Trainer: Anyway, I am here to teach you how to do your job. I know what you’re thinking, right? Why does a self directed app based business need someone to train every single user? And to that I say, shut up. First off, choose a file.

set dossier_scene = true
#Two options show up they are both:

#Image: Blandest person ever
#Dossier: Jane Doe

Trainer: Jane was a retail sales employee. She hated Mondays. Her 1.94 children loved playing and fun. She died by a heart attack at 77.28 years old.
set character = 2

Trainer: Yes, I know they are the same, it’s for demonstration purposes, and good thing too. A person that average would collapse space time.

Player:
- I’ll choose Jane!
	Trainer: Sounds good. 
- Jane’s my choice!
	Trainer: A rebel, eh?
- Why are you doing this to me?
	Trainer: You say you want Jane, eh?

set dossier_scene = false 
set driving_scene = true 

Trainer:Ok, so now you are gonna go pick her up, and drive her to her ultimate fate. But that’s the easy bit. The hard part is getting them to talk about themselves. The stuff they did. The worse the better. Cause that pushes up their fare, and the higher the fare, the longer they stay in Purgatory and out o’ the bosses’ way. Then you let them out and after a quick dunk in the Styx, they are good to go. We clear?

Reap: You work as a driver for soulsharing app DeadLyft.
Reap: You've been tasked with trying to ferry the souls to the everafter.
Reap: As you drive, you'll engage in conversations with patrons and have to make choices about where to push the conversation.
- Tell me more.
	Reap: Of course!
- End the convesation. => END
- Start again => tutorial_start_node

Reap: You see, Hell runneth over. So the higher-ups have tasked you with extending the stay of souls in purgatory. 
Reap: The more information you can harvest from an individual, the longer their stay in purgatory will be.
Reap: Your task is to get as much information as possible without upsetting a soul too much.
- So I'm trying to get them to tell me the terrible things they did without realizing it?
	Reap: Yep, basically.
- End the convesation. => END
- Start again => tutorial_start_node
Reap: As souls tell you their mischief, you'll see the fare increase.
Reap: You need to make you daily quota of course. We're professionals here.
Reap: Any questions?
- Yeah, what you mean by fare? => fare_node
