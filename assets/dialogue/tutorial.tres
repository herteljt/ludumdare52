He married his high school sweetheart Eleanor and raised a family of four kids, the eldest a boy and the other three girls. He was laid off in the eighties and worked a series of retail jobs until his retirement in 2014, and he has been painting watercolors in his spare time since.  

Dossier: 
He died of a blow to the head from his lovely wife Eleanor. => Mike_Dowager

Trainer: Ok, next. Who are you, then?
Player: 
- It’s me, Death!
	You picked \"It's me, Death!\"
- I’m Death, bub!
- Are these really my only choices?


Trainer: Yes, those are your only choices. They’ll matter later, I promise. And you are NOT Death. We’d have to pay you overtime if you were Death. You’re a Non-living Contractor, and NLC. You’re only one of many, and you CAN be replaced.

Player:
- Nope!
	Trainer: Fine, I’ll make it easy, pick up, make them talk to you about bad stuff they did, then drop them in the Styx.
- Yes!
	Trainer: Amazing. Someone with half a brain left rattling around in that bone box.
- examples, please!
	Trainer: I’m getting to that!

Trainer: Anyway, I am here to teach you how to do your job. I know what you’re thinking, right? Why does a self directed app based business need someone to train every single user? And to that I say, shut up. First off, choose a file.

set dossier_scene = true
#Two options show up they are both:

#Image: Blandest person ever
#Dossier: Jane Doe

Trainer: Jane was a retail sales employee. She hated Mondays. Her 1.94 children loved playing and fun. She died by a heart attack at 77.28 years old.
set character = 2

Trainer: Yes, I know they are the same, it’s for demonstration purposes, and good thing too. A person that average would collapse space time.

Player:
- I’ll choose Jane!
	Trainer: Sounds good. 
- Jane’s my choice!
	Trainer: A rebel, eh?
- Why are you doing this to me?
	Trainer: You say you want Jane, eh?

set dossier_scene = false 
set driving_scene = true 

Trainer:Ok, so now you are gonna go pick her up, and drive her to her ultimate fate. But that’s the easy bit. The hard part is getting them to talk about themselves. The stuff they did. The worse the better. Cause that pushes up their fare, and the higher the fare, the longer they stay in Purgatory and out o’ the bosses’ way. Then you let them out and after a quick dunk in the Styx, they are good to go. We clear?
